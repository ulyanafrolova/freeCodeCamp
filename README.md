This repository contains my completed projects from the Data Analysis with Python course by freeCodeCamp.

## Projects

### [Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator](https://github.com/ulyanafrolova/freeCodeCamp/blob/main/mean_var_std.py)

Transforms a list of 9 numbers into a 3×3 matrix and computes mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum across rows, columns, and the entire matrix. Built with NumPy and designed with input validation.

### [Demographic Data Analyzer](https://github.com/ulyanafrolova/freeCodeCamp/blob/main/demographic_data_analyzer.py)

This project analyzes demographic data from the U.S. Census dataset using Python and pandas and represents the following calculations:

·number of individuals in each race category

·average age of men

·percentage of people with a Bachelor's degree

·income statistics based on education level

·minimum weekly work hours and percentage of high earners among them

·country with the highest percentage of people earning >50K

·most common occupations in India

The dataset [adult.data.csv](https://github.com/ulyanafrolova/freeCodeCamp/blob/main/adult.data.csv) is provided by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) for educational purposes.

### [Medical Data Visualizer](https://github.com/ulyanafrolova/freeCodeCamp/blob/main/medical_data_visualizer.py)

Processes and visualizes a dataset of medical examinations. Calculates BMI to classify patients as overweight, normalizes cholesterol and glucose data, and produces two visualizations:

Categorical Plot – compares health indicators between patients with and without cardiovascular disease. [See result here](https://github.com/ulyanafrolova/freeCodeCamp/blob/main/catplot.png)

Heatmap – shows correlations between medical variables after filtering outliers. [See result here](https://github.com/ulyanafrolova/freeCodeCamp/blob/main/heatmap.png)
