·Matplotlib

·Pandas

·NumPy

·Seaborn


## Projects

### [Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator](https://github.com/ulyanafrolova/freeCodeCamp/blob/main/mean_var_std.py)

Transforms a list of 9 numbers into a 3×3 matrix and computes mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum across rows, columns, and the entire matrix. Built with NumPy and designed with input validation.

### [Demographic Data Analyzer](https://github.com/ulyanafrolova/freeCodeCamp/blob/main/demographic_data_analyzer.py)

This project analyzes demographic data from the U.S. Census dataset using Python and pandas and represents the following calculations:

·number of individuals in each race category

·average age of men

·percentage of people with a Bachelor's degree

·income statistics based on education level

·minimum weekly work hours and percentage of high earners among them

·country with the highest percentage of people earning >50K

·most common occupations in India

To test this project, use the [adult.data.csv](https://github.com/ulyanafrolova/freeCodeCamp/blob/main/adult.data.csv) dataset provided by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) for educational purposes.

### [Medical Data Visualizer](https://github.com/ulyanafrolova/freeCodeCamp/blob/main/medical_data_visualizer.py)

Processes and visualizes a dataset of medical examinations. Calculates BMI to classify patients as overweight, normalizes cholesterol and glucose data, and produces two visualizations:

Categorical Plot – compares health indicators between patients with and without cardiovascular disease. [See result here](https://github.com/ulyanafrolova/freeCodeCamp/blob/main/catplot.png)

Heatmap – shows correlations between medical variables after filtering outliers. [See result here](https://github.com/ulyanafrolova/freeCodeCamp/blob/main/heatmap.png)

### [Page View Time Series Visualizer](https://github.com/ulyanafrolova/freeCodeCamp/blob/main/time_series_visualizer.py)

Analyzes daily page views from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) between May 2016 and December 2019, cleans the dataset(removes the top and bottom 2.5% of page views to eliminate extreme outliers and converts the date column into a datetime index for easier time-series handling) and creates visualizations(.png files) that highlight long-term trends and seasonal patterns in website traffic:

Line Plot - shows overall page views over time and highlights the long-term upward/downward trends. [See result here](https://github.com/ulyanafrolova/freeCodeCamp/blob/main/line_plot.png)

Bar Plot - displays the average monthly page views for each year and helps compare year-to-year performance. [See result here](https://github.com/ulyanafrolova/freeCodeCamp/blob/main/bar_plot.png)

Box Plots - year-wise box plot shows how the distribution of page views changes over years and month-wise box plot reveals seasonal patterns across different months. [See result here](https://github.com/ulyanafrolova/freeCodeCamp/blob/main/box_plot.png)
